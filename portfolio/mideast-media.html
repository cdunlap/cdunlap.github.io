  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Starting in 2013, the talented team at Northwestern University in Qatar (NUQ) has commissioned a six-nation survey about media use in the Middle East. To show trends in media usage among Arab countries, this annual survey culls results from more than 6,000 respondents throughout Egypt, Lebanon, Qatar, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates.</p>
  <p>With extensive survey results and no way to easily share their findings with the public, NUQ reached out to <a href="http://columnfivemedia.com/" target="_blank">Column Five</a> to create a website with interactive data explorations for further user examination. We’ve been honored to partner with NUQ on this comprehensive project for all three years, eagerly enjoying getting to work on such a vast undertaking in new and exciting ways. The challenges and rewards in this year’s project proved no different.</p>
