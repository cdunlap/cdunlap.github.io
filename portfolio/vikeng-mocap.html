  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This is a tool that I wrote for recording and reviewing motion capture data as well as gesture library data for <a href="{{'/portfolio/gdis.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">MMIST</a>. We used it to record new gestures into the gesture recognition database as well as review virtual locomotion (walking/running in a virtual world) information.</p>
  <p>This project is a native application written in C++ using <a href="http://www.juce.com/" target="_blank">JUCE</a> and <a href="http://www.visualizationlibrary.org/documentation/index.html" target="_blank">Visualization Library</a>.</p>
