  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>CTask is a really simple task management system that I wrote back in 2006 to manage incoming requests from testers while I worked on Firearms 2 (never released, now defunct). After <a href="{{'/portfolio/firearms2.html' | prepend: site.baseurl}}">Firearms 2</a> development halted I released the code for CTask on GitHub. It uses SQLite and PHP and is themeable via jQuery UI themeroller (though I haven't tested that in a while).</p>
