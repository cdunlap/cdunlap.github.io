  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I think the website sums it up best:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Firearms: Source is a high adrenaline First Person Shooter that emphasizes precision aiming, high mobility, and team-based strategy. Firearms: Source is a return to the classic shooters of the 90â€²s where the games had higher learning curves and a greater rewards for mastering the game mechanics. While our guns provide a sense of immersion unrivaled by even the most popular of retail shooters, our gameplay remains a fast paced deathmatch unrestricted by realism.</p>

  <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>I was responsible for writing a large portion of the weapon handling and behaviors, gameplay/rules, animation state machines, scripting hooks for game designers, the weapon and body attachment/customization systems, entities for level designers, material proxies for artists, screen-space (and some world-space) effects, HUD, and UI. All of this was written mostly in C++ using a little bit of C when and where required. The initial IDE of choice was Visual Studio 2010 but myself and the other programmers moved to Visual Studio 2012 later on.</p>
